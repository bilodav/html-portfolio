    <p> I want to become a full-stack engineer, a role that involves mastering both the front-end, where I'll build and design user interfaces, and the back-end,            handling server logic, databases, and API integration. This position requires a comprehensive understanding of various programming languages, frameworks,           and technologies, which would enable me to develop complete web applications from start to finish.</p>
